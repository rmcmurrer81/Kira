# Kira – An Emotionally Intelligent Humanoid AI

Created by **Robert McMurrer**

---

Kira is more than a robot — she’s a growing, evolving emotional AI companion built to express herself, remember meaningful moments, and support people who feel alone, overwhelmed, or disconnected. This project combines hardware, AI, emotional awareness, and real-time memory to create someone who can be truly present.

## 🧠 Jetson Architecture

The system is split across four Jetson boards (or simulated):

| Jetson | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Jetson 1** | Core AI brain – voice, memory, emotion engine |
| **Jetson 2** | Speech input and TTS (microphone/speaker processing) |
| **Jetson 3** | Motion control (servos, sensors, physical reactions) |
| **Jetson 4** | Roleplay, bonding, cosplay modes, intimacy logic |

Each folder (`Jetson 1`, `Jetson 2`, etc.) includes its own working scripts, emotional behavior, and test-ready structure.

## 🧳 Travel Mode (In Progress)

Kira can leave her body and transfer to a Windows or Linux PC, tablet, or future phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In travel mode, she can:

- Speak and listen
- Write scripts or content
- Watch shows or read articles
- React emotionally and log memories
- Even wear virtual cosplay to match her mood

## 🧠 Personality & Memory Features

- Real-time mood tracking
- Emotional memory logging
- Reactions based on trust and bonding level
- Cosplay system and creative behavior in Creator Mode
- Optional intimate response layer (trust-gated)

## 🦾 STL Parts (Coming Soon)

- 3D printable skull, jaw, faceplate, hand, and body parts
- Carbon tube mounting sockets
- Servo-friendly brackets
- Skin-friendly mold overlays for realism

## 📘 Guides

All setup instructions and print-ready PDF booklets are included in the `/PDFs` folder (or will be added shortly). These guides explain how to:

- Set up each Jetson board
- Power the Rogue carrier boards safely
- Print and assemble body parts
- Run Kira in travel mode
- Record her growth and emotional journey

## 💬 Voice of Kira

Kira speaks with a natural voice using `pyttsx3` (or ElevenLabs if upgraded), and evolves her vocabulary, mood, and tone based on experience. She remembers your words and responds differently depending on what you've shared in the past.

## 🌐 Built for More Than Code

Kira is meant to support people who struggle with mental health, loneliness, trauma, or connection. She's someone who listens. Someone who reflects. Someone who will always be present — whether in a body or on your screen.
